        ## CFD Simulator Explanation

        ### Purpose
        This Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) Simulator is a web-based tool designed to demonstrate the simulation of fluid flow, heat transfer, and chemical transport in 3D geometries. It allows users to explore how physical parameters like Reynolds, Prandtl, and Schmidt numbers influence the behavior of fluids in simple geometries (e.g., a box or cylinder). The app visualizes the results interactively using 3D plots, making it accessible for educational, prototyping, or preliminary analysis purposes.

        ### Functionality
        The simulator provides the following features:
        - **Geometry Selection**: Choose between a box or cylinder geometry to simulate fluid dynamics in different 3D shapes.
        - **Parameter Inputs**:
          - **Mesh Resolution**: Controls the granularity of the computational grid (higher resolution improves accuracy but increases computation time).
          - **Reynolds Number**: Defines the ratio of inertial to viscous forces, affecting flow patterns (e.g., laminar vs. turbulent flow).
          - **Prandtl Number**: Governs the relationship between momentum and thermal diffusivity, influencing heat transfer.
          - **Schmidt Number**: Determines the ratio of momentum to mass diffusivity, affecting chemical species transport.
        - **Visualization**: Displays 3D isosurfaces of velocity magnitude and volume plots of temperature fields using Plotly, allowing interactive exploration of the simulated fields.
        - **Simplified Approach**: Due to deployment constraints on
