        ## CFD Simulator Explanation

        ### Purpose
        This Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) Simulator is a web-based tool designed to demonstrate the simulation of fluid flow, heat transfer, and chemical transport in 3D geometries. It allows users to explore how physical parameters like Reynolds, Prandtl, and Schmidt numbers influence the behavior of fluids in simple geometries (e.g., a box or cylinder). The app visualizes the results interactively using 3D plots, making it accessible for educational, prototyping, or preliminary analysis purposes.

        ### Functionality
        The simulator provides the following features:
        - **Geometry Selection**: Choose between a box or cylinder geometry to simulate fluid dynamics in different 3D shapes.
        - **Parameter Inputs**:
          - **Mesh Resolution**: Controls the granularity of the computational grid (higher resolution improves accuracy but increases computation time).
          - **Reynolds Number**: Defines the ratio of inertial to viscous forces, affecting flow patterns (e.g., laminar vs. turbulent flow).
          - **Prandtl Number**: Governs the relationship between momentum and thermal diffusivity, influencing heat transfer.
          - **Schmidt Number**: Determines the ratio of momentum to mass diffusivity, affecting chemical species transport.
        - **Visualization**: Displays 3D isosurfaces of velocity magnitude and volume plots of temperature fields using Plotly, allowing interactive exploration of the simulated fields.
        - **Simplified Approach**: Due to deployment constraints on Streamlit Cloud, this version uses synthetic (mock) data to mimic CFD results, ensuring compatibility without requiring complex dependencies like FEniCS.

        ### Technical Details
        - **Original Design**: The simulator was initially built using FEniCS, a powerful library for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) like the Navier-Stokes equations (for fluid flow), heat equation, and species transport equation. It used `gmsh` for 3D mesh generation, `meshio` for mesh conversion, and `pyvista` for post-processing, with results visualized via Plotly.
        - **Current Implementation**: To run on Streamlit Cloud, which lacks support for FEniCS system dependencies (e.g., MPI, PETSc), this version generates synthetic data based on mathematical functions modulated by user inputs. For example:
          - Velocity magnitude is computed as `sin(πx) * cos(πy) * (1 / (1 + Re*z))`, where `Re` is the Reynolds number.
          - Temperature is modeled as `exp(-Pr*(x² + y² + z²))`, with `Pr` as the Prandtl number.
          - These mimic realistic CFD fields but are not true solutions to PDEs.
        - **Libraries**:
          - `streamlit`: Provides the web interface for user inputs and visualization.
          - `numpy`: Handles numerical computations for the synthetic data.
          - `plotly`: Creates interactive 3D plots (isosurfaces for velocity, volume plots for temperature).
        - **Limitations**:
          - The current demo does not solve actual PDEs due to the absence of FEniCS. For full CFD simulations, deploy on a platform supporting Docker (e.g., Google Cloud Run, Render.com) with a FEniCS-based setup.
          - Synthetic data provides a qualitative visualization but lacks the accuracy of true CFD solvers.
        - **Future Enhancements**: For production use, integrate a proper CFD solver (e.g., FEniCS, OpenFOAM) by deploying on a Docker-compatible platform or allowing users to upload precomputed simulation data.

        ### How to Use
        1. Select a geometry (box or cylinder).
        2. Adjust the mesh resolution and physical parameters (Reynolds, Prandtl, Schmidt numbers).
        3. Click "Run Simulation" to generate and visualize synthetic velocity and temperature fields.
        4. Explore the 3D plots interactively by rotating, zooming, or panning.
        5. For real CFD simulations, follow the instructions in the info box below to deploy on a platform supporting FEniCS.

        This demo is ideal for educational purposes or visualizing CFD concepts without heavy computational requirements.
